# MEC24 Workshop

Contains code used during the MEC24 `LibEMG` workshop. `walkthrough.ipynb` contains an interactive API walkthrough and `online_walkthrough.py` showcases online functionality of `LibEMG`.

These interactive walkthroughs highlight some key functionality of `LibEMG`, but not everything is shown. Please consult the [documentation](https://libemg.github.io/libemg/index.html) or the [source code](https://github.com/LibEMG/libemg/tree/main) for a more in-depth look at the API.
